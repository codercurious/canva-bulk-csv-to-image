## How it works

If you are looking to automate social media post image generation, from set of templates and huge amounts of dataset, then this solution is for you.

Using this cloud based tool you can also generate images using real time data such as stock market updates, news, viral tweets or posts using the cloud based API.

Once you have completed your canva template design, insert variable names into sections of your design where dynamic data should be inserted. The variable names should follow this syntax: `{{variableName}}`

Then generate sharing link for your design and pass it this tool along with csv data
